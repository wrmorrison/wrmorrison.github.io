<h2>1. If I were in charge, I would make the following changes to the workshop:</h2>
<h6>Session 1</h6>
<p><strong>b1</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>b2</strong>: The workshop was very well planned, organized and executed. I don't think I would change anything on it.</p>
<p><strong>b3</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>b4</strong>: Excellent workshop for time allotted. If you have more time, the Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools should be further highlighted. These tools seem really important and I plan to watch youtube videos to increase my proficiency/skill with these tools.</p>
<p><strong>b5</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>b6</strong>: <span class="not-selected">Entire post-survey was skipped by this attendee</span></p>
<p><strong>b7</strong>: The only thing I might change would be the length of the class just so that more info can be provided on masks or adding a secondary class that can get more into masking at the beginning stage.</p>
<p><strong>b8</strong>: Extend the course time to 6 hr.</p>
<div class="hr-small"><!--hr --></div>
<h6>Session 2</h6>
<p><strong>y1</strong>: Well, I'd really like a whole series of workshops! I think that I'd definitely take a longer course from you. Your style of teaching brought a lot of clarity to the subject. Great selections of pics &amp; assignments.</p>
<p><strong>y2</strong>: All was great. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>y3</strong>: Add ~ 30 minutes. Leave lights on.</p>
<p><strong>y4</strong>: It would be fun to add one more exercise at the end where we took 2 pictures we liked from the Internet + tried to mask them to take something home to hang on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>y5</strong>: Give more exercises or challenges. I thought I understood while going through the exercises but once I did not have the step by step I felt lost.</p>
<p><strong>y6</strong>: N/A</p>
<p><strong>y7</strong>: Add, for each exercise, a list of commands used.</p>
<p><strong>y8</strong>: Perhaps, in the first two exercises - make students do 1st steps repeatedly until they have the basics down. The idea behind a mask is abstract, so to understand the use of them takes practice. Have them NOT SAVE the image until they can create it themselves w/out your help. Then go on to cover the tools you use to create. Have them use different tools on the same image so they understand the different uses. More exercises = more practice! Thanks Bill</p>

<h6>Session 3</h6>
<p><strong>r1</strong>: Instructor is key to the workshop success.</p>
<p><strong>r2</strong>: More time. Divide into 2 classes. Go home after first + do homework</p>
<p><strong>r3</strong>: None</p>
<p><strong>r4</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>r5</strong>: For more participant involvement (&amp; if time permits) at the end of an exercise, ask for a volunteer to &quot;drive&quot; a demo on the screen &amp; other participants can help if volunteer gets stuck.</p>
<p><strong>r6</strong>: Nothing. Wonderful job. I learned more in 3 hours than previous lab classes.</p>
<p><strong>r7</strong>: No response</p>

<h2>2. Do you have any additional comments about this workshop?</h2>
<p><strong>b1</strong>: A bit difficult for my previous &quot;expertise&quot; level with Photoshop but good nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>b2</strong>: Great and helpful. I definitely need to practice everything I've learned to jump from intermediate to expert. (see Personal Experience, question #2)</p>
<p><strong>b3</strong>: My thanks to Bill for undertaking this task for his Master's. We beginners benefitted + added a lot of knowledge to our meager knowledge of making full expert use of CS5. I feel so lucky to have had a patient instructor as Bill to teach us. For Free!! We definitely made out.</p>
<p><strong>b4</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>b5</strong>: Definite necessary for those who want to learn more</p>
<p><strong>b6</strong>: <span class="not-selected">Entire post-survey was skipped by this attendee</span></p>
<p><strong>b7</strong>: I really enjoyed the workshop but I Love the website and additional website so that when I get home and try it on my own I have something to fall back on.</p>
<p><strong>b8</strong>: Very useful, can put course work to immediate use</p>
<div class="hr-small"><!--hr --></div>
<h6>Session 2</h6>
<p><strong>y1</strong>: I really liked how you have the handouts + the website to support reinforcing the lesson. Thanks so much!</p>
<p><strong>y2</strong>: None</p>
<p><strong>y3</strong>: As always Bill Morrison shows himself to be the master at communicating complex ideas and encouraging interaction.</p>
<p><strong>y4</strong>: I liked it a lot and think Bill is the best teacher at PNM. I can't wait to try this at home! Thank you for the class and opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>y5</strong>: Fantastic; really helped to bring Photoshop skills to next level.</p>
<p><strong>y6</strong>: Excellent workshop learning materials provided! I particularly like the opportunity to visit the instructor's website after the workshop to review the exercises and gain more practice.</p>
<p><strong>y7</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>y8</strong>: No response</p>
<div class="hr-small"><!--hr --></div>
<h6>Session 3</h6>
<p><strong>r1</strong>: Very comprehensive yet delivered in easy to grasp way through instructor's ease in explaining using personal experiences and step-by-step process.</p>
<p><strong>r2</strong>: Great class. Great instructor - Fan - too</p>
<p><strong>r3</strong>: Great. Fun class. Took some of the fear I had with Photoshop. Made it seem easy to use ... with practice.</p>
<p><strong>r4</strong>: Thank you for offering this. I really enjoyed myself and can't wait to practice/use what I've learned today!</p>
<p><strong>r5</strong>: None. Great content. Really enjoyed and feel that got a lot of good information &amp; practice.</p>
<p><strong>r6</strong>: No response</p>
<p><strong>r7</strong>: Pace and content of class was appropriate at this level. Excellent class. Learned a lot.</p>
