<p><strong>Please offer any additional thoughts on how I might improve future masking workshops.</strong></p>
<p>I thought it was great and covered a lot for the time allotted. Thanks again for the opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>You were pretty good and thorough, so you just need to figure out how to FORCE US TO PRACTICE WHAT WE LEARNED. :)</p>
<p>&quot;The workshop was great, Bill!  I liked having the supporting handouts.</p>
<p>Not sure how you might improve them--perhaps adding the video tutorials would help.  </p>
<p>Also, taking it one step further, you could ask participants to bring their own photos in to work with.  This makes it much more complex, since people will have to resize their photos and so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, great work and it was a wonderful introduction to Photoshop for a newbie like myself!&quot;</p>
<p>This was a good one.  Are there any materials you written up summarizing what we did?  I'd like to duplicate those.</p>
<p>Give a area at the end where everyone can work on their own project and you can help critique, if that doesn't take too long.</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of would be to make it into a full day workshop and add a few more exercises</p>
<p>The workshops are great as is but if I were to suggest, well, in the intro and purpose, it would be additionally helpful to provide more than the technique and usage of the tools to achieve an end result but some creative thoughts about the creative process or what if's to launch from.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison your style of teaching has taken me farther than any other class I've been in. You make me feel as if I'm with a buddy working on a project. I feel calm and I have fun. You encourage my appetite for learning and exploring and taking chances. It would be difficult to improve on any class given by such a gifted Sensei. Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to imprint process, I would like to have the opportunity to do an exercise &quot;&quot;from scratch&quot;&quot; on my own computer with the instructor present.  I recognize that this might not be practical, unless it were a course requirement for students to bring their own laptops to class.</p>
<p>Another general comment relevant to computer workshops in general--in order to &quot;&quot;imprint learning,&quot;&quot; provide verbal cues and ask students to repeat orally.  e.g.: &quot;&quot;Repeat after me: I have just created a mask based on a selection....&quot;&quot; Then ask students to describe physical steps on keyboard... (may sound retarded, but my contention is that learning computer skills is much like learning a musical instrument--so it's language/rhythm patterns must be understood and absorbed through repetition.)&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Please describe ANY masking efforts you've made since the workshop?</strong></p>
<p>I definitely have improved when cropping (cutting out) images. Very helpful.</p>
<p>Tried to repeat the Big Ben masking project when had time.</p>
<p>I've completed 3 collages using my own photographs and scans.</p>
<p>I'm exploring GIMP at this time.  I'll be wanting to duplicate some of the things we've done.</p>
<p>I have successfully masked two images that I had drawn into one.  I also have used a lot of the hue/saturation effects to help make my projects look and feel warmer or just better.</p>
<p>I practiced the exerices on the website and the handout to see if I could repeat them at home.</p>
<p>Nothing has come up for me to get busy and create something but have spent some time repeating the workshops exercises.  I found that it's different on my PC, it's not an Apple, so it's taking me some time to get adjusted.  I think I need to take some Photoshop classes to learn how to maneuver around existing layers and add masking or other changes in a document that someone else has created. </p>
<p>  This class changed my entire perspective and work flow of Photoshop. Until I took this class I thought I was pretty good at PS, only to find I was still a beginner. I no longer work destructively in my projects, and work without fear of mistakes or having to start over and lose precious time.</p>
<p>Immediately after the workshop, I went home and practiced the exercises.  I ran into several snags, however.  At first, I was not able to bring images into PS.  When I resolved this issue, I was not able to work with the layers properly.  I contacted instructor for guidance. I was able to solve the layers problem and then experimented and was able to replicate exercises #1 &amp; #2, but unable to repeat others.  </p>
