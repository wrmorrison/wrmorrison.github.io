<h1>Web Site Design Services</h1>
<div id="home-tree"> <img src="site-media/web-steps.gif" alt="Bill Morrison | Web Site Design Services" width="166" height="215" /></div>
<p>When it comes to having a website built, your options range from highly skilled design firms with bloated pricing to under skilled armatures offering sub-professional pricing. It's important for you to stay in the sweet spot: skilled designer, realistic pricing. The sweet spot is you (happy with services) and designer (happy with payment). Enter the Web Site Design Services of Bill Morrison.</p>
<p>Website design is constently evolving and you should hire a designer who has keep up to speed. I have been fortunate to train under and assist some of the foremost leaders in the industry. I also teach the technologies I practice.</p>

<div id="faq-services">
<h4>Do you do both initial designs and existing site re-designs?</h4>
<div id="faq-services-a1">
<p>Absolutely -</p>
<p>Have an idea, project, product or service that needs a web presence? - <strong>I can create it</strong></p>
<p>Have an existing site that needs additions, reorganization, a modern look, modern code and technology? - <strong>I can re-create it</strong></p>
</div>
<h4>What do your services cost?</h4>
<div id="faq-services-a2">
<p>In my experience web service pricing comes in different forms depending on the work involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Per hour</strong> for xhtml/css &amp; graphics = <strong>$65</strong></li>
<li><strong>Per page</strong> includes look &amp; feel, text, navigation, images, graphics = <strong>$150</strong></li>
<li><strong>Site cost</strong> is often based on client honesty (i.e. &quot;<em>Bill, I have $x.xx budgeted for a site, what can we do?</em>&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Updates</strong> may be billed hourly, by the page or project based depending on the update request </li>
<li><strong>Discounts</strong> may apply but are up to my discretion</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>How does a web project typically proceed</h4>
<div id="faq-services-a3">
<ol>
<li>Contact me (email or telephone) to discuss the project</li>
<li>Lock down and agree on a project budget and scope of services
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: mid-project scope changes <em>may well</em> result in budget chances (increase scope &raquo; increase budget)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find your Domain Name (ex. www.bill-morrison.com) and website hosting company
<ul>
<li>I currently recommend and use <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank">bluehost</a> for both Domain Name purchases and web hosting (you pay &lt;$100/yr)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collect site material (text, images, video etc) from you
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: the actual content you put on you site needs to come from you - it's you idea, project, product or service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4>What don't you do?</h4>
<div id="faq-services-a4">
<p>With honesty being the best policy...</p>
<p>I do not write my own complex ActionScript (Flash) or JavaScript though I am capable to utilizing (and modifying) code written by brilliant others.</p>
<p>I am not a php/mysql database wizard...yet</p>
